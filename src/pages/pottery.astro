    I throw on the wheel and experiment with making my own glazes in my home studio. My favorite things to make are big vases and mugs. I'm drawn to nature-inspired textures - mosses, mushrooms, organic geometry - and I like building up lots of layers in both glaze and surface design. Lately I've been exploring ways to incorporate electronics into ceramic forms.
